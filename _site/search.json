    "text": "If you are an R user who is struggling to access HARPS GTO sample dataset and who have the question that Can‚Äôt we reproduce the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) results that already exist? in their mind, this blog is for you. Today, I will introduce my workflow of accessing processed data from original data, downloading the processed data, data processing to initialize cluster labels, and show my surprising findings on reproducing tSNE results.\nThis example is relevant to the paper, ‚ÄúDissecting stellar chemical abundance space with t-SNE‚Äù (Anders et al.¬†2018, Astronomy & Astrophysics 619, A125).\nFor simplicity, I added all the codes separately and linked them through the process.\nPlease note that, you will need to \\(\\color{green}{\\text{install python library}}\\) called open_data which you can find in open_data.py as the initial step."

    "text": "Data processing steps already followed by open_data library\nThe original data can be find in the GitHUb repository of the authors as DelgadoMena2017.fits which includes some existing cluster labels and abundance determination for \\(\\color{blue}{\\text{Mg, Al, Si, Ca, TiI, Fe, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, ZrII, Ce, and Ba}}\\). This file contains details regrading \\(\\color{red}{\\text{1059}}\\) stars.\nThen, how we get only \\(\\color{red}{\\text{530}}\\) stars? ü§î\nLet‚Äôs investigate‚Ä¶\nAccording to the authors, the sample needed to be analyzed in a more restricted temperature range to obtain reliable tSNE abundance maps. The reason is that specific abundance trends seem to dominate underlying temperature trends. Therefore,\n\nchoose an effective temperature range of \\(\\color{brown}{5300 \\text{ K} < T_{eff} < 6000 \\text{ K}}\\).\n\nIn this step, only \\(\\color{green}{539}\\) stars were satisfied. Next,\n\nexclude stars with \\(\\color{brown}{\\text{log } g_{HIP}} < 3\\) which remove \\(\\color{green}{\\text{one}}\\) star.\n\nThen,\n\nselect successful abundance determination for \\(\\color{brown}{\\text{Mg, Al, Si, Ca, TiI, Fe, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, ZrII, Ce, and Ba}}\\) which use as input for tSNE.\n\nOnly \\(\\color{green}{533}\\) stars are remained because others contain missing values. Furthermore,\n\nto compensate the fact that tSNE does not take into account individual (heteroscedastic) uncertainties in the data, the authors followed the approach of Hogg et al.¬†(2016) and rescaled each abundance by the median uncertainty in that element, assuming an abundance uncertainty floor of 0.03 dex. Additionally,\nremove stars which did not coverge by using the age determination code, StarHose code.\n\nThe \\(\\color{green}{3}\\) stars are discarded.\nIn our final sample, there is only \\(\\color{green}{530}\\) stars. üëè\nNote: Do not need to consider the above steps because open_data package already done it for us."
