    "text": "If you are an R user struggling to access HARPS GTO sample dataset and have the question that Can’t we reproduce the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) results that already exist? In their mind, this blog is for you. Today, I will introduce my workflow of accessing processed data from original data, downloading the processed data, and data processing to initialize cluster labels and show my surprising findings on reproducing tSNE results.\nThis example is relevant to the paper, “Dissecting stellar chemical abundance space with t-SNE” (Anders et al. 2018, Astronomy & Astrophysics 619, A125).\nFor simplicity, I added all the codes separately and linked them through the process.\nPlease note that you will need to \\(\\color{green}{\\text{install python library}}\\) called open_data, which you can find in open_data.py as the initial step."

    "text": "Data processing steps already followed by open_data library\nThe original data can be found in the GitHub repository of the authors as DelgadoMena2017.fits, which includes some existing cluster labels and abundance determination for \\(\\color{blue}{\\text{Mg, Al, Si, Ca, TiI, Fe, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, ZrII, Ce, and Ba}}\\). This file contains details regarding \\(\\color{red}{\\text{1059}}\\) stars.\nThen, how do we get only \\(\\color{red}{\\text{530}}\\) stars? 🤔\nLet’s investigate…\nAccording to the authors, the sample needed to be analyzed in a more restricted temperature range to obtain reliable tSNE abundance maps. The reason is that specific abundance trends dominate underlying temperature trends. Therefore,\n\nchoose an effective temperature range of \\(\\color{brown}{5300 \\text{ K} < T_{eff} < 6000 \\text{ K}}\\).\n\nOnly \\(\\color{green}{539}\\) stars were satisfied in this step. Next,\n\nexclude stars with \\(\\color{brown}{\\text{log } g_{HIP}} < 3\\) which remove \\(\\color{green}{\\text{one}}\\) star.\n\nThen,\n\nselect successful abundance determination for \\(\\color{brown}{\\text{Mg, Al, Si, Ca, TiI, Fe, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, ZrII, Ce, and Ba}}\\) which use as input for tSNE.\n\nOnly \\(\\color{green}{533}\\) stars have remained because others contain missing values. Furthermore,\n\nto compensate for the fact that tSNE does not take into account individual (heteroscedastic) uncertainties in the data, the authors followed the approach of Hogg et al. (2016) and rescaled each abundance by the median uncertainty in that element, assuming an abundance uncertainty floor of 0.03 dex. Additionally,\nremove stars that did not converge by using the age determination code, StarHose code.\n\nThe \\(\\color{green}{3}\\) stars are discarded.\nThere are only \\(\\color{green}{530}\\) stars in our final sample. 👏\nNote: You do not need to consider the above steps because the open_data package has already done it for us."

    "text": "Today, I will introduce what are the initial steps that you need to follow when setting up a Python virtual environment in R for the shinyapps.io server.\nNote: You need to have an account in shinyapps.io server. The page can be found in here.\nFirst, you need to create a ‘.Rprofile’ file within the directory of your shiny app. Then, initialize a suitable name for the \\(\\color{red}{\\text{Python virtual environment}}\\).\n\nVIRTUALENV_NAME = \"new_env\"\n\nAfter that, we need to set environment variables in the ‘.Rprofile’ file as follows.\n\nSys.setenv(PYTHON_PATH = 'python3')\n# Installs into default shiny virtualenvs dir\nSys.setenv(VIRTUALENV_NAME = VIRTUALENV_NAME) \nSys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = paste0('/home/shiny/.virtualenvs/', \n                                      VIRTUALENV_NAME, '/bin/python'))\n\nThe next step is to create the \\(\\color{red}{\\text{Python virtual environment}}\\). To do that, you can write the following code chunks in server.R or your shiny app script.\nIn there, first of all, you need to get the environment variables.\n\nvirtualenv_dir = Sys.getenv(\"VIRTUALENV_NAME\")\npython_path = Sys.getenv(\"PYTHON_PATH\")\n\nNext, create a Python virtual environment by specifying the Python path.\n\nreticulate::virtualenv_create(virtualenv_dir, python = python_path)\n\nThen, you have to install Python dependencies. To do this, you can install the packages by directly specifying them.\n\nreticulate::virtualenv_install(virtualenv_dir, packages = c(\"pandas==1.3.5\")) \n\nIf not, can use requirement.txt which contains all the packages.\n\nreticulate::virtualenv_install(virtualenv_dir, c(\"-r\", \"requirements.txt\"))\n\nFinally, define the Python virtual environment to be used by reticulate.\n\nreticulate::use_virtualenv(virtualenv_dir, required = TRUE)\n\nDone…👏"
